Things that need done:

*****************************SATURDAY 9/19*******************************

1st things first:
- Format date into Unix then send to database
- Figure out how to get current date, and use that in order to get TodaysTransactions.


- Finish creating and updating components (daily, weekly, monthly, annually, savings projections)
- Figure out how we're determining each user's fixed salary. 



-Are we building an API? 
-How are we making calculations? Mongo should handle that after we code it to. 
-Are we hard coding the equations or can a relatable API do the job?



-React-bootstrap/CSS
